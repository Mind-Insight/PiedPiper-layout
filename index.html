        Beneath the flashy homepages of your favorite sites lurk Hooli™ and other evil corporations out to hoard and
        sell your most personal data.

        What was built to be the ultimate platform for the free sharing of knowledge has turned into a money-hungry
        monster feasting on our privacy and freedom.

        But fear not, for Pied Piper has the answer! And it’s simple:
        An autonomous peer-to-peer network featuring distributed storage powered by universal compression, accelerated
        scheduling allocation, and end-to-end encryption.

        Put even simpler — <span>it’s the internet, completely decentralized.</span>
